# Multiple-Image-Slideshows
Changed the slide show code taken from https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp so that it would work for multiple slideshows.

This is done by adding a second argument to the functions plusSlides and showSlides that is unique for each one and then assigning the value of slides depending on that value passed.
